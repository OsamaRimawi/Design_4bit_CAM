# Design_4bit_CAM
Design of a cutting-edge CAM (content-addressable memory ) cell using 9T device chip using 22nm or lower. undertake a large circuit design problem, going from specification to implementation while optimizing for speed, area, and/or power.

### In this repository You can Find all the CAM schematics using Spice tool.

### all the layouts using Microwind tool using 22nm technology.

### Also you can find an IEEE Paper

### and a powerpoint presentation
